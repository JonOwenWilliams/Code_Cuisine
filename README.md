## Project Overview

Code Cuisine is a fully functional resturaunt website featuring a booking system that allows customers ro reserve tables online, and view menu options and also allows staff to manage bookings. This project adheres to Agile methodology and follows MVC framework principles.

### Main pages:

- Home Page - Displays resturant details and location.
- Menu Page - Showcases food and drinks.
- Booking Page - Allows customers to reserve and cancel their table.
- Admin Page - A secure page that allows staff to manage bookings.

## Agile Workflow

The development process was dynamic and adaptive, making room for continuous improvements along the way. Instead of rigidly planning everything upfront, features were built in small, manageable stages, tested frequently, and adjusted while testing. This ensured that the final product was as functional and user-friendly as possible.

I used Trello to help me keep on track with my projects with me making certain tasks more of a priority.

I also added comments below to help me understand what was needed for each feature.

## MVC Structure

This project is structured in a way that users input their data from the interface, It is then procecced through controlled logic, and finaly stored and retrived in a database.

Customers will enter their details on the booking page.
